# Population-Density-Map

The source of the dataset used for analysis is Kaggle. The dataset contains the number of people per square kilometer for countries worldwide. The population density values in the dataset span the years 1961 through 2015. 
The analysis is implemented using R and the Leaflet library. I have used the average population density for each country from 1961 to 2015 to map colors on the map.
The dark green color indicates that the country is one of the highest population-dense countries.
